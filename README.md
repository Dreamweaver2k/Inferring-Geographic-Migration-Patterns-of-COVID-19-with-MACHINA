# Inferring-Geographic-Migration-Patterns-of-COVID-19-with-MACHINA
The rapid spread of COVID-19 revealed how ill-prepared the world was to stop the outbreak of a highly infectious disease. Understanding how diseases spread and the routes they take is crucial for stopping future pandemics. Metastatic and Clonal History INtegrative Analysis (MACHINA) is a program for inferring migration patterns between anatomical sites of tumors using DNA sequencing data. While other methods can recover migration patterns of tumors in the body, MACHINA was designed to recover migration patterns by minimizing the number of migrations and comigrations (sites connected by a migration). This means the program attempts to extract migration patterns with the assumption that a migration between two sites is more likely to reoccur than a new migration to another site. There is, however, the potential to use this powerful tool to infer migration patterns between geographic sites based on DNA sequencing data of COVID-19. Inferring this migration pattern using MACHINA and correlating it to an observable factor such as flight volume or geographic proximity could give us a better understanding of the avenues infectious diseases take to spread across the globe.
